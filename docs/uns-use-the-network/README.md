# Interacting with the <uns>uns.network</uns>

Users can interact or let say 'use' the <uns>uns.network</uns> in multiple ways depending on user's needs.

If you're familiar with the <uns>uns.network</uns> environement, you may be interested to use the [cheat sheet](cheatsheet) to get a quick overwiew of usefull commands and APIs.

### Use the CLI, to go fast with basic actions

The CLI (Command Line Interface) has been designed to facilitate basic actions and testing. With the CLI you can create a wallet, mint a @unik-name into the chain, update user's properties, list existing tokens or query the status of the network, and many other things. 

The CLI runs with the MAINNET but also with the DEVNET for integration testing.

### Use the APIs, to consume network services

All network services can be used via the <uns>uns.network</uns> APIs. This is the best way for developers to integrate <uns>uns.network</uns> services into their own developpements and APPs.

### Use the SDKs, to quickly embed <uns>uns.network</uns> features, and @unik-name solutions, withing APPs

SDKs have been developped to simplify developer work when they integrate @unik-name solutions within their plateforms or their APPs.

### Use Wallets and @unik-name APP

Wallets are end user tools, ready to use to transfer and to manage tokens. 

@unik-name mobile APP is the prefered user APP within our ecosystem. 

First of all @unik-name mobile APP is used to: 
1. to authenticate connection to any web platform, 
1. to manage his/her @unik-names,
1. to manage his/her personal data linked with @unik-names,

but @unik-name mobile APP is also used : 
- to handle and transfer UNS tokens, 
- to handle and transfer UNIK tokens, 
- to trigger transactions over the network and requiring tokens,
- to consume network services

### Use the DEVNET, to test your developments, or to test new features

The DEVNET is a uns.network dedicated for testing, it's operated by some delegates of the community.

You can connect a node to the DEVNET by configuring the CLI, SDK, and even a dedicated chain explorer.

#### What can you do with the DEVNET ?

- Creating test accounts
- Developing and testing applications for free (use the faucet to get DUNS tokens)
- Testing existing applications against new releases or release candidates of <uns>uns.network</uns> Core

Please note that **this network is ephemeral**, and may be reset anytime. Resets will be announced several days before the effective operation, so follow [announcements published on the unik-name forum](https://forum.unik-name.com/c/uns-network).

#### DEVNET faucet

If you need DUNS tokens to test the <uns>uns.network</uns> features (creating your UNIK for example), you can ask for DUNS on [the unik-name forum](https://forum.unik-name.com/new-topic?title=Request%20for%20DUNS&category=uns-network/faucet&tags=faucet,devnet).
Don't forget to provide your wallet address, created with [the <uns>uns.network</uns> CLI](cli.html#create-wallet) or [the desktop wallet](wallet) (it must start with a `D` letter, such as `DHxZ4PSU9uaDeEhsfinn8jCempbLwwyFQB`).
