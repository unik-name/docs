# Understanding unikname.network

In the Internet-era, identifiers are everywhere. We share them by phone or we write them down to our friends and family. We do not want them to be complex, we like when they’re expressed in our language and we love when they are unique and personalized. Designed for everyday uses, these human-readable identifiers should be easy to remember, unique and usable everywhere on the web. We use it to login on our favorite websites, to share public or private data, to communicate with others, or simply to be identified. They must be private and protect our privacy, and, most importantly, our identifiers should be under our sole control.

<brand name="uns"/> is a decentralized network and protocol dedicated to handling IDs rooted in the blockchain, aiming to secure any web and mobile user connections, and to protect users' privacy. 

This blockchain is specialized in providing Decentralized ID (also called DID), and offers a good Distributed Public Key Infrastructure (also called DPKI) solution, the basis of the next generation of authentication protocols.

The blockchain is fueled by its own native token, the $UNIK, a protocol and utility token.

<brand name="uns"/> and its ID are the backbone of the Unikname solutions : 
- **`UniknameID`:** Augmented username under the sole control of its owner. UniknameID are self-sovereign and easy to remember multi-purpose ID. They can replace email and password for fully confidential sign-up and login, or be used to control the sharing of personal or business information over the web, and many more...
- **`Unikname Connect`:** Unikname Connect is a private-by-design authentication solution, rewarding users who want to make internet a safer place.
- **`Unikname Certificate Proofing`:** the solution to secure mobile apps against falsified TLS/SSL X509 certificates and against man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **`Unikname URL-Checker`:** the solution to store a public proof of ownership of a URL over the web, could be a domain name, an image, a social account or any file.

<brand name="uns"/> has been designed to be used easily by everyone who needs to integrate self-sovereign identifiers in their software and applications, not only dAPP but also any traditional web platform. 

## Main Features

### :fire: Issuance and Minting of Decentralized ID as NFT

**:sparkles: Self-Sovereign Identifier NFT**. <brand name="uns"/> Decentralized ID are represented on the chain as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT). They are unique, available any time and everywhere. Individuals or Organizations have ultimate control over their identifier and are the final arbiter of who can access and use the related data. 

**:sparkles: Featured NFT**. <brand name="uns"/> DID are Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT) with peerless features like badges, properties... and crypto-accounts.

**:sparkles: Easy to Remember Pseudonymous ID.** <brand name="uns"/> DID have an easy to remember format that could be a pseudo, a real name, or any funny name. We don’t care about your real identity. 

**:sparkles: Anti-Squatting Protections.** <brand name="uns"/> DID integrate an original life cycle management protecting them against squatting.

### :fire: User Rewarding System

**:sparkles: <brand name="uns"/>'s utility token, the $UNIK, is used to encourage users to maximize the use of their UniknameID** to make the internet more secure and more trustful.

### :fire: On-Chain / Off-Chain Control

**:sparkles: <brand name="uns"/> DID's owners use their ID in either an off-chain or an on-chain mode.** They control the privacy level and the sharing of their data: fully private, with white lists, open... and ID stay fully private when they are used for authentication.

### :fire: Highly resilient and highly secure

**:sparkles: The decentralized design makes the solution highly resilient and highly secure**, far beyond any traditional centralized system. 

### :fire: Compatible with existing web & mobile apps

**:sparkles: <brand name="uns"/> API and SDK can be easily used in any web and mobile apps**, even traditional centralized ones (heavy client, SaaS, Platforms...)

## Main Specifications

**:trophy: <brand name="uns"/> DID follow the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) standards.** Unikname.network team is an active member of the DIF and contribute to the definition of tomorrow's standards.
[see DIF UNIKNAME DID Specifications](https://github.com/unik-name/did-method-spec/blob/main/did-uns/UNS-DID-Specification.md)

**:trophy: <brand name="uns"/> DID are multilingual and protected against spoofing by SafeTypo© technology**. 14 UNICODE scripts are accepted, with many alphabets.

**:trophy: <brand name="uns"/> is a [DPOS blockchain operated by 23 elected delegates](/key-concept/network-governance).** The blockchain is powered by the famous ARK.IO DPOS Blockchain, setup with a 8 seconds block time. Delegates are grouped in colleges of stakeholders:

* 10 Individuals – Defenders of individual freedoms and privacy
* 10 Organizations – Committed in securing the web for businesses
* 3 Network community players

**:trophy: <brand name="uns"/> Supply of $UNIK utility token is dynamic and follows adoption.** $UNIK tokens are created when DID are created on the chain and when they become alive. This design makes the token less prone to speculation and more stable.

## Key Benefits

### For Network Players

:moneybag: <brand name="uns"/> represents an opportunity to participate, to contribute and to get valuable rewards with a viable DPOS blockchain solution. You are contributing to securing the first Decentralized IDentifiers (DID) operational blockchain with its easy to understand use cases.

### For Organizations

:moneybag: <brand name="uns"/> offers a backbone solution to provide confidential authentication, with `Unikname Connect`, to their users, customers and partners. This is the easiest and safest MFA authentication solution for any saas platforms and mobile apps, providing a protection against economic espionage.

### For Web Users

:moneybag: Web users have a change to get a Self-Sovereign ID usable everywhere on the web and protecting them  against identity theft thanks to the blockchain technology. They become actor of tomorrow's internet and contribute to make the Internet more secure and more trustworthy, and they're rewarded for that!

## The network

We're maintaining 2 public networks, a live one and a test one.

### LIVENET

LIVENET is the main network (equivalent to _mainnet_ on other blockchains).
Tokens are **valuable** and you can use them on a day to day basis for the long life.

This network is live since may 2020 and you can access this network via the public [livenet explorer](https://explorer.unikname.network/).

### SANDBOX

SANDBOX is the development network (equivalent to _testnet_ or _devnet_ on other blockchains).

It is used to test and discuss new features with community before making them available for all.
Tokens are **valueless** (you can get them for free [from the faucet](/interacting-with-uns.html#sandbox-faucet).
You can use them to test next features and your apps based on UNIKNAME tokens. 

You can access this network via the public [sandbox explorer](https://sandbox.explorer.unikname.network/).
