# Network Service Providers <Badge text="Key Concept"/>

<brand name="uns"/> provides services through specialized nodes called Service Providers Nodes. These nodes are like gateways and make the bridge between the decentralized network and the traditional web. They provide services to @unikname ID owners in exchange for UNIK tokens. They are core in the <brand name="uns"/> tokenomics. 

Network Service Providers Nodes are [operated under licence](#service-provider-node-operator-licence), granted by the community. 

Elementary services provided are called `Network UniT Services (NUTS)`. All available services are listed in a directory called the `Directory Of Network Unit Services (DONUTS)`
