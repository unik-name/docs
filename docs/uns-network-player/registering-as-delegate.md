# Registering as a delegate

[[toc]]

## Getting some UNS

On the <uns/> network, the functions we are going to use are blockchain transactions that have fees.
It is therefore necessary to have [UNS](https://docs.uns.network/uns-network-tokens/#the-uns-token) to be able to carry out the rest of the operations.

If you do not have a UNS, there are two possibilities:
- Obtaining UNS via faucet
- Come and ask for UNS on the [forum](https://forum.unik-name.com)

## Installing the <uns/> CLI

The <uns/> Command Line Interface (CLI) makes it easy to manage your @unikname and Unikname apps directly from the terminal.
Itâ€™s an essential part of using <uns/>.

### Download & install the CLI

Follow the link corresponding to your OS.

You are now ready for the next step !

## Registering as a delegate

Congratulations! Now that you have:
* cryptoaccount with some UNS
* @unikname linked to your cryptoaccount

Now, you can register as a delegate!

Here is the complete process:


    $ uns unik:disclose "@hello-world" -e "hello-world"
    $ uns delegate:register "@hello-world"
    $ uns delegate:vote "@hello-world"

## Checking your delegate status in the Explorer

You can check on [explorer](https://explorer.uns.network/delegate-monitor) that your @unikname is in the delegate list.
To start forging blocks, you'll need to set up a node.

## Setting up your node

To set up your node, you can open in a new tab the [following instructions](https://docs.uns.network/uns-network-setting-up-node/#introduction).

## Checking your delegate status in the Explorer

Now, your job is done.
You can check on [explorer](https://explorer.uns.network/delegate-monitor) that you're in the delegate list (either in `active` or `standby` tab).

If you're in the `active` tab, congratulation, you're a <uns/> delegate, and your forger node is actually forging blocks and getting rewards!
If you're in the `standby` tab, you need to gather more voting power than current active delegates (i.e. have cryptoaccounts with positive balance voting for you).
