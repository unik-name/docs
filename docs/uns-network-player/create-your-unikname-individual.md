## Coupon

Creating a @unikname requires a coupon. If you have one, you can continue. 
Otherwise, contact us on *contact@unikname.com* to request one.

## Create your @unikname

Once you have your coupon, all you have to do is create your @unikname!

Don't forget to backup and secure your passphrase, it will allow you to retrieve access to your @unikname in case you change your device.
Neither <uns/>, nor Unikname will be able to give you back access to your @unikname.
