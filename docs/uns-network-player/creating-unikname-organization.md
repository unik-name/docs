The <uns/> Command Line Interface (CLI) makes it easy to manage your @unikname and Unikname apps directly from the terminal.
It’s an essential part of using <uns/>.

*: you should then add `{TARBALL_EXTRACTION_FOLDER}/bin` into your `PATH` environment variable in order to be able to run `uns` command.

[Alternate installation modes are also available in the CLI documentation](/uns-use-the-network/cli.html#download-and-installation).

:::tip On Windows

You are now ready for the next step !

## Creating your cryptoaccount

### Creating and saving your cryptoaccount informations

Your cryptoaccount is required for all the following steps. To create it, just execute the following command: `cryptoaccount:create`.
Here is an example of what you are supposed to see on your command prompt.
```bash
uns cryptoaccount:create
» :warn: This information is not saved anywhere. You need to copy and save it by your own.;
{
  "address": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
  "publicKey": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
  "privateKey": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
  "passphrase": "XXXXX XXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXX XXXXXXX XXXX XXXXX",
  "network": "livenet"
}
```

:::warning
**You have to copy and save preciously these informations! If you lost these informations, you'll also lost access to your cryptoaccount and your @unikname.**
:::

## Vouchers

Creating a @unikname requires a voucher. If you have one, you can continue. 
Otherwise, contact us on [contact@unikname.com](mailto:contact@unikname.com) to request one.

## Create your @unikname

Once you have your voucher, all you have to do is create your @unikname!

**Don't forget to backup and secure your passphrase**, it will allow you to retrieve access to your @unikname in case you change your device.
Neither <uns/>, nor Unikname will be able to give you back access to your @unikname.

With <uns/> CLI you can create your own UNIK token using [`unik:create`](/uns-use-the-network/cli.html#unik-create) command.

:::warning Choosing the @unikname
Choose the @unikname wisely. Indeed, it'll be disclosed to other people and they'll know you by this @unikname and once you've chosen a name, you won't be able to change it.
:::

As example, for creating the UNIK `organization` token `SpaceElephant`:

```bash
uns unik:create --explicitValue "SpaceElephant" --type organization --unik-voucher

Enter your crypto account passphrase (12 words phrase): ***************************

{
  "data": {
    "id": "ccabe13311350a306d510c3484889a151eda9a1b61b5fe4d346fd3b1eeb42c25",
    "transaction": "4bcde02ec632bd5531aa8710b0a13f469a59caec910dc610d46f6b8ebdcaf9ac",
    "confirmations": 1
  }
}
```
::: tip UnikId
Write somewhere your unikId (`id` here, with value `ccabe13311350a306d510c3484889a151eda9a1b61b5fe4d346fd3b1eeb42c25`)! You need it in the following instructions.
:::

### Checking the creation of the @unikname in the Explorer

With the transaction id given into your command prompt, you can check the @unikname creation through [the explorer](https://explorer.uns.network/). Look for the @unikname by its unikId in the search bar on the top.

You can also directly go to `https://explorer.uns.network/${unikid}` in your browser.
For example, [https://explorer.uns.network/uniks/ccabe13311350a306d510c3484889a151eda9a1b61b5fe4d346fd3b1eeb42c25](https://explorer.uns.network/uniks/ccabe13311350a306d510c3484889a151eda9a1b61b5fe4d346fd3b1eeb42c25) for the @unikname `SpaceElephant`.

And now, [let's go registering your organization as a delegate](./registering-as-delegate).
