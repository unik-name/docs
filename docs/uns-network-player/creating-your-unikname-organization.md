## Create your @unikname

Once you have your coupon, all you have to do is create your @unikname!

*Once you've chosen a name, you won't be able to change it. So choose it carefully!*

Don't forget to backup and secure your passphrase, it will allow you to retrieve access to your @unikname in case you change your device.
Neither <uns/>, nor Unikname will be able to give you back access to your @unikname.
