# Becoming a uns.network Player


## Become a delegate on the SANDBOX

As prerequisite to be a delegate, you must have :
- a wallet with positive balance with at least 30 SUNS (you can request SUNS [from the faucet](/uns-use-the-network/#sandbox-faucet)).
- a [forger node](/uns-network-setting-up-node/#run-a-forger) configured with your wallet passphrase.

Then, all process can be done through the [desktop wallet](/uns-use-the-network/wallet.html#basic-wallets).

On wallet detail screen, expand top bar options and choose `Register Delegate`

Choose a delegate name (warning, you won't be able to update your name) and input your passphrase (or password).

Finally submit your transaction.

Now, your job is done. You can check on [explorer](https://sandbox.explorer.uns.network/#/delegate-monitor) that you're in delegate list (either in `active` or `standby` tab).

If you're in the `active` tab, congratulation, you're a <uns/> delegate, and your forger node is actually forging blocks and getting rewards.

If you're in the `standby` tab, you need to gather more voting power than current active delegates (i.e. have wallets with positive balance voting for you).
