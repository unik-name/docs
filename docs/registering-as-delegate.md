## Registering as a delegate

Congratulations! Now that you have:
* a cryptoaccount with some UNS
* a @unikname linked to your cryptoaccount

Now, you can register as a delegate!

::: warning Registering as a delegate

:warning: You are about **registering yourself as a <brand name="uns"/> delegate**. :warning:

Don't execute the following command if you are trying to create your @unikname id to integrate your application with Unikname Connect. [Go to the Unikname Help Center](https://help.unikname.com/3-unikname-connect/) instead.

:::

Here is the complete process:

```
uns unik:disclose "@hello-world" -e "hello-world"
```

```
uns delegate:register "@hello-world"
```

```
uns delegate:vote "@hello-world"
```

Replace `hello-world` by your own @unikname id.

## Checking your delegate status in the Explorer

You can check on [explorer](https://explorer.uns.network/delegate-monitor) that your @unikname is in the delegate list.
To start forging blocks, you'll need to set up a node.

Let's now configure your UNS node.
