# Wallets

## Basic Wallets

Both UNS and UNIK tokens are manageable with a command line interface (CLI). But this is not really user-friendly. 

ArkEcosystem comes with a lot of out-of-the-box tools for bridgechains like UNS. Among those tools, we have the awesome [Desktop Wallet](https://ark.io/wallet) which is fully compatible with uns.network. From a single wallet application, you can manage your ARK **AND** UNS tokens easily. By default, the app connects to Ark.io mainnet. But with a simple configuration, you can connect it to <brand name="uns"/> too. Let's do it !

### How to setup the default ARK Desktop Wallet to work with UNS tokens

> :warning: *this tutorial has been written for the Ark desktop wallet verion `2.7`. It **may** work with newer versions.*

First of all, download and install the app for your platform : https://ark.io/wallet  *(works with Windows, macOS and Linux)*

You must setup the wallet for ARK tokens first, then you will be able to setup the wallet to work with the UNS tokens. 

So, follow Ark [instructions](https://docs.ark.io/tutorials/usage-guides/how-to-use-ark-desktop-wallet.html) on how to setup and use the application. 

From now, you should have a perfectly configured desktop application to manage your ARK tokens.
To manage UNS tokens it's simple and it requires only two additional steps: 
- setup a new network configuration
- create a new dedicated profile.

#### step 1. Setup the uns.network configuration

Go to `manage network` section (bottom-left of navigation bar).  
![manage-network](/images/manage-network.png)

Then click on : `Add a new network` (top-right)  
![add-network](/images/new-network.png)

Fill inputs:

::: details For Livenet
- name: **UNS Livenet**
- description: **<brand name="uns"/> LIVENET**
- seed server: **http://163.172.146.222:4200**
:::

::: details For Sandbox
- name: **UNS Sandbox**
- description: **<brand name="uns"/> SANDBOX**
- seed server: **http://51.159.75.146**
:::


And click on `Fetch` to automatically get full node configuration (like token name, explorer url or wallet derivation keys).

Guess what ðŸ¤”, you've just completed the first step to configure your wallet ! Congrats ðŸŽ‰

#### step 2. Create a dedicated profile

Click on your profile (last item of navigation bar).  
Then `Add profile` (top-left). 
![add-profile](/images/add-profile.png)

Fill-in all inputs like you did for Ark profile.  
Now, in step `2. Network` you can choose the freshly appeared `UNS Livenet`/`UNS Sandbox` item.  
![network](/images/network.png)

At the end, you should have a fully configured Desktop wallet able to transfer UNS tokens, create <brand name="uns"/> wallets, vote for <brand name="uns"/> delegates, or any other features inherited from ArkEcosystem.

If you want to start playing:
- On the Livenet, you should [get a @unikname first with the My Unikname app](#unikname-app)
- On the Sandbox, you can get `SUNS` [from the FAUCET](/interacting-with-uns.html#sandbox-faucet).

> NOTA: Management of UNIK tokens is not able with the default Ark Wallet, it requires the installation of the Unikname APP.

## Unikname APP

The Unikname mobile APP is not only an app to manage your owns @unikname and its properties.
The Unikname mobile APP is also a wallet.
This APP embed cryptographic and secured features like handling pass phrase, handling private keys and calculating public addresses. 

So the Unikname mobile APP is the preferred user APP to manage @unikname but also UNS tokens, UNIK tokens, and to trigger transactions requiring tokens.

Install it at [https://my.unikname.app](https://my.unikname.app) and get your first @unikname!
