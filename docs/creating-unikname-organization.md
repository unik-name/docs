You are now ready for the next step !

## Creating your cryptoaccount

### Creating and saving your cryptoaccount informations

Your cryptoaccount is required for all the following steps. To create it, just execute the following command: `cryptoaccount:create`.
Here is an example of what you are supposed to see on your command prompt.
```bash
uns cryptoaccount:create
Â» :warn: This information is not saved anywhere. You need to copy and save it by your own.;
{
  "address": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
  "publicKey": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
  "privateKey": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
  "passphrase": "XXXXX XXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXX XXXXXXX XXXX XXXXX",
  "network": "livenet"
}
```

:::warning
**You have to copy and save preciously these informations! If you lose these informations, you'll also lose access to your cryptoaccount and your @unikname.**
:::

## Using a COUPON to create the organization @unikname 

Creating an organization @unikname requires a COUPON. If you have one, you can continue. 
Otherwise, [go to the UNS Forum](https://forum.unikname.com/c/uns-network/7) to request one.

## Create your @unikname

Once you have your coupon, all you have to do is create your @unikname!

**Don't forget to backup and secure your passphrase**, it will allow you to retrieve access to your @unikname in case you change your device.
Neither <brand name="uns"/>, nor Unikname will be able to give you back access to your @unikname.

With <brand name="uns"/> CLI you can create your own UNIKNAME token using [`unik:create`](/cli.html#unik-create) command.

:::warning Choosing the @unikname
Choose the @unikname wisely. Indeed, it'll be disclosed to other people and they'll know you by this @unikname and once you've chosen a name, you won't be able to change it.
:::

As example, for creating the UNIKNAME `organization` token `SpaceElephant` with the coupon you have received:

```bash
$ uns unik:create --explicitValue "SpaceElephant" --type organization --coupon "HERE_THE_COUPON"
Enter your crypto account passphrase (12 words phrase): ***************************
{
  "data": {
    "id": "ccabe13311350a306d510c3484889a151eda9a1b61b5fe4d346fd3b1eeb42c25",
    "transaction": "4bcde02ec632bd5531aa8710b0a13f469a59caec910dc610d46f6b8ebdcaf9ac",
    "confirmations": 1
  }
}
```
::: tip UnikId
Write somewhere your unikId (`id` here, with value `ccabe13311350a306d510c3484889a151eda9a1b61b5fe4d346fd3b1eeb42c25`)! You need it in the following instructions.
:::

### Checking the creation of the @unikname in the Explorer

With the transaction id given into your command prompt, you can check the @unikname creation through [the explorer](https://explorer.unikname.network/). Look for the @unikname by its unikId in the search bar on the top.

You can also directly go to `https://explorer.unikname.network/${unikid}` in your browser.
For example, [https://explorer.unikname.network/uniks/ccabe13311350a306d510c3484889a151eda9a1b61b5fe4d346fd3b1eeb42c25](https://explorer.unikname.network/uniks/ccabe13311350a306d510c3484889a151eda9a1b61b5fe4d346fd3b1eeb42c25) for the @unikname `SpaceElephant`.

And now, [let's go registering your organization as a delegate](./registering-as-delegate).
